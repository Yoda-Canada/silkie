# Contributing

Contributions are highly welcomed and appreciated. Every little bit of help counts, so do not hesitate! However, before making a pull request, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Preparing Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally using [git](https://git-scm.com/) and create a branch
3. Follow the instructions in [Getting Started](README.md#Getting-Started)
4. Install git hook scripts: `pre-commit install` (Before installation, ensure your Flake8 configuration in `tox.ini` has not been modified)
5. Manually test all existing features (**Automation tests are on the way...**)

After completing all the steps above, you're all set to make a Pull Request ðŸŽ‰!
